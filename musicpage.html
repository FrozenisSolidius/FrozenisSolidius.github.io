    <img src="Technics.jpg" alt="A Turntable" class="abimage">
    <p class="text">Honestly, My taste in Music is pretty interesting to say the least. Unlike the average person my age, I don't really listen to new music. So if you were to ask me if i liked new music? Absolutely not. In fact, my song tastes is all before the 90s, with a few exception to the 2000s.
        Here's a Few of my selections. </p>

        <h1 class="head">Masayoshi Takanaka: Japanese Guitarist with Tropical Style</h1>
        <p class="text">I absolutely love this guy's music. His music is like a japanese love letter to Brasilero Music and Tropical Music. His range on music is pretty limited to Jazz fusion, but he knows how to make very nice sounding tunes
            on that guitar. I discovered him around 2016 and have never stopped listening ever since. Here's an excerpt from his song "Beleza Pula", from his album with the same name.

        <h1 class="head">Pat Metheny: Lead Guitarist of Pat metheny Group, Accoustics & Jazz Maestro</h1>
        <p class="text">To call Pat metheny "strange" is an understatement. This man is so good, it's almost alien. Normally, on a song, you follow a time signature. Something like 3/4s or 2/4s, but this guy's guitar work is all over the place, you can't really 
            track him. In fact, it's magical that he makes it all work. Here's an excerpt from his song: "So May it Secretly Begin", from his album: "Still Life (talking)"

        <h1 class="head">TOTO: a 6-man ensemble of talented rock pioneers</h1>
        <p class="text">TOTO's first namesake album was released in 1978 and it was an instant hit. Songs like "Hold the Line" and "Georgy Porgy" were an instant classic and fan favorite everywhere. In fact, they're such iconic music that Georgy Porgy is still played
            at the RJ Bistro at the Dusit Thani Hotel for each Band's Rest period. Question was, why were they so popular? It's simple, really. While most rock bands were doing instruments only, they shined in the vocals department. Bobby Kimball, TOTO's Lead Vocalist,
            had so much vocal range that it blended amazingly with the guitar and keyboard work. In fact, here's an excerpt from their song "Girl Goodbye" from their namesake album.

        <p class="text">To claim top charts within a matter of months is quite the amazing feat, and they were able to do that. Alot of their music is very interesting to say the least, with most of it being funk. But, the funny part about them is that despite being under 
            the jazz term, they've got extremely high energy music and good lord, it is intoxicating! It's just the type of music that'll make you jump up and dance. Not to mention, the lead Singer Jason Kay, has a crazy vocal range that'll even put Bruno Mars to shame. Actually, There was 
            once an interview with Bruno that shows him saying Jason Kay was one of his inspirations. Here's an excerpt from the song "Cosmic Girl" From their Hit album "Travelling without Moving".

        <p class="text">VST & Company is probably one of the very few Filipino artists I listen to. Not to sound unpatriotic, it's just that almost all of our music nowadays sound the same. But then again, my parents, aunt and uncles weren't lying when they said 
            it was very different back then. Music had so much SOUL. So much feeling that it just makes me want to keep it playing thru the night. That's funny too, since their music was mainly disco. In fact, here's an excerpt from their song "Swing" from their namesake album.

            <h1 class="head">Junko Ohashi: A City Pop Diva with a powerful Tone</h1>
            <p class="text">Thanks to the internet nowadays, City pop has been slowly booming in popularity. In case you're unaware, City Pop is a genre that mostly consists of 70s-80s Japanese Pop Hits. Although not limited to Japanese, it's been used as a permanent label to 
                these kinds of music now. Here's the thing, I discovered City pop in my earlier years; say around 2015-2016? It wasn't really that popular. People who knew City Pop were usually just old Japanese people, or Japanese Natives. Something about her music just sounds so beautiful,
                almost angelic. Her vocal range is powerful, and one of the beautiful ones i've heard. But, it's better for you to hear it instead. Here's an excerpt from her song "夢を見ようよ" or "Let's Dream" from her Album "Full House". Fun fact, this song is a collaboration between her
                and "Minoya Central Station", A Band she likes to work with.

            <p class="text">Now, it's their words, not mine. The Japanese claim that Tatsuro is THE God of City pop, and honestly I can't deny that. This man's singing voice IS godly. If Junko had the voice of an Angel, this man had the sound of a much, much higher being.
                I can never get enough of listening to Tatsuro, his music is just so replayable. I'm having difficulty just trying to explain what it's like to listen to his music, so it's best for you to hear it instead. Here's his Song "Loveland, Island" from his "For You" Album.

                <h1 class="head">Marcos Valle: Brazilian Jack of All Trades, Master of the Eras</h1>
                <p class="text">Marcos Valle was born in 1943, and has been making music since his early adult life in the 60's. During this time, Brazil's music was mostly Samba, Bossa Nova, or Jazz. He of course followed that, and he did it very well. In fact, he's one of the
                    recognized pioneers of Bossa Nova that popularized it around the world. Now the reason why I claim this man as the Master of the Eras, is that he's been doing so many different music styles that it surprises me. He did Disco and Jazz in the 70s, a bit of electronic and dance in the 80s,
                    Accoustics in the 90s, etc. The List goes on, and on. Mind you, at the time of me writing this, he is currently 81 Years old and still makes music. Best Part? He looks exactly the same. It's like he doesn't age! His singing voice never changed either. It's always been the same, silky smooth
                    voice he's had since the 60s. Here's what he sounds like, on one of his Songs "Não Tem Nada Não", in his Album "Previsão do Tempo".

                <h1 class="head">Christopher Cross: Yacht Rock's Deserved Poster boy</h1>
                <p class="text">Now there's this genre of music that I really like, and I was surprised had a term coined recently. I just knew it as some sort of subgenre of rock, well, it is. But, turns out the genre's now being called
                    "Yacht Rock". Its any kind of rock that you listen to while on a yacht, funny. Basically rock aspects in music that instills the feeling of calmness, the water, waves and the Ocean. Christopher Cross, is one of those men. His music
                    is very very pleasing to hear, and it almost feel sad. Whenever I hear him sing, or any of his music, his voice is just so calming it makes me want to cry. It's like the feeling of nostalgia hitting you as a wave, and it sometimes hurts.
                    But, that's what makes him and his music so magical. He's got this specific comforting tone that just gets you in your heartstrings. In fact, here's one of his all-time Hits called that was used in a movie. This one is "Arthur's theme" or "Best that you can do" from his album
                    "Arthur".
