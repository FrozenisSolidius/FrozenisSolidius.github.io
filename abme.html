    <p class="text">My name is Aaron John Dizon. I am 19 year old, born on June 3, 2005. I live in Taguig city, and currently study at CIIT College of Arts and Technology under the Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Multimedia and computing.<br>
    I started this journey when i was but a young child, say around 2008-2009, i gained "consciousness" or finally had a proper grasp around my surroundings. My dad was a fervent gamer, and had been playing games since his college days. Thanks to that, i was able to
play on his old PlayStation 2 as early as 4 years old! I already had a headstart on console gaming than my peers. Best part? My dad taught me everything i needed to know about how to operate the system. Things like how RCA Cables work, how to work the plug, how to
use the CD tray, and many more. In fact, this skill showed very much in my Kindergarten days. While all the kids were whining and crying, sticking toys up their noses, I already had the edge in tech.</p><br>

<h1 class="head">Early School years</h1> <p class="text">There was a time where I was in a Computer class and the teachers
were teaching us how to use a keyboard and what the parts of the PC were. While all the kids were doing Hunt-and-peck typing(its when you use two fingers, one from each hand.), i was already fleshing out the foundation of using more than two fingers. Although, this class
wasn't always sunshine and rainbows.<br>
One of the teachers i had strictly enforced the Typing standard where you had to split the keyboard based on where your hand is(things like ASDF for the left and HJKL for the right). The thing is, I HATED that. I had my own way of typing and this teacher was so adamant
on teaching this. After all, I learned how to type from my father so i'd be lying if i was prideful of how I Typed. Despite all this, I never changed. Which is funny, since she preached about me being a slow typer if i continued my method of typing. My fastest recorded
typing speed sits at around 130-140 WPM. It's already faster than the average Person, so I think she was wrong.<br>

Moving on to Gradeschool, I didn't really particularly enjoy it. I studied in Pasig Catholic College, and it wasn't a great place despite it being such a big catholic school. I was a bully victim, which is funny for me to think about it now since I was a big kid. Mind you, i'm a 6 Foot 19 year old weighing about 90 Kilograms. I have more than enough wallop to take the average
Filipino kid down. I was teased alot for speaking english, and being weak to jokes. Also, I was made fun of for having FILA shoes. Most of my classmates were from rich families, so i'm not particularly surprised now that they'd laugh at me for apparently not having Nikes? But back then
I never really understood why they picked on me for having a different brand of shoes. But Outside of school? Life was great! In fact, my best years outside of school was my early ones. Particularly Grade school.</p>

<h1 class="head">Frequent Flyer</h1>
<p class="text">My Family travelled ALOT. We went to alot of different countries, and alot of places here in the Philippines. In fact I am forever grateful to my family for giving me the chance to travel since it shaped me and my knowledge to how I am today. We went to places like Singapore, Hong Kong, 
    Thailand, and so many many more. In fact, we still travel today! So far, I've currently been to: </p>
    <ul> (In chronological order:)
        <li>Hong Kong</li>
        <li>Singapore</li>
        <li>Malaysia</li>
        <li>Thailand</li>
        <li>Taiwan</li>
        <li>The Maldives</li>
        <li>United States</li>
        <li>Japan</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text">Honestly, i've been to so many places it still surprises me to this day. But of course, i'll stay forever greatful for it.</p>

    <h1 class="head">Middle years</h1>
    <p class="text">Moving on, I graduated out of Gradeschool and it felt great to be finally out of that god awful school. But, I still had this hidden fear of what's yet to come for Junior High. For my junior years, i studied in APEC Schools pateros where I finally felt like I 
        belonged. I met so many great people in this school, and had an absolute blast during my stay here. First off, the teachers were extremely lenient. Things like deadlines and schedules were very loose. Second, They were all young. Now I have nothing against older professors and teachers. It's just that 
        back in my Gradeschool years, all the old teachers were just cranky and constantly angry. Not to mention this was a Catholic school, so religion had to be added in to the mix somehow. Trust me when I say i had a sigh of relief when there were young staff in my Junior Highschool. Third, the school was so close to where I live.
        Getting home was barely even 10 minutes! Finally, my classmates. I had so much fun with these people that I can confidently say they shaped who I am today. I learned how to toughen up and take a joke, learned how to explore outside of my safezones, etc. <br>
         It was great, until COVID came. a day of suspension turned into two. Two turned into 5. then a Month, 2 months, it just kept going.</p>

         <h1 class="head">The Pandemic</h1>
         <p class="text">There was so much free time i had NO idea what to do with it. It was just a never ending cycle of getting up in the morning, getting on the computer then going to bed. For the first time in my life, I actually hated no school. This was of course, until I decided to experiment.<br>
        You see, I play alot of Roblox. Now, on roblox, there are these small "communities" or groups that do all sorts of things. Say for example, a roleplay group for a specific period of time? Maybe War Reenactment? The likes. Now, I decided to join an Automotive centered one. Put simply, a car community.
    Now I've been in this community for awhile already, since i started playing Roblox since 2014. Now, in these communities, obviously you need a car. To get said cars, you have two options: You either build them, or you don't. I couldn't build, so I resorted to ripping models from existing games.
I was ok with it since i was able to drive and all that, but sometimes the model looked terrible. Sometimes, i didn't even like the car. I was at a dead-end and i was running out of things to do on the platform. Come 2020 when covid decided to strike, I REALLY wanted to build this one particular car and no other game had it
as a 3D model, so I mustered up the courage and decided to take up <b>3D Modelling.</b> <br><br>All it took was One night, a cup of coffee, and no sleep, whatsoever. I bingewatched 10, 24-minute Youtube videos and learned everything I needed to know on 3D modelling a car, specifically. After that night, I was able to build a car succesfully. Well, kind of.
There was a myriad of problems, starting from the fact that it was ugly. Modelling works in a way where it's multiple vertices or dots, connected to each other to form a shape. It's kind of like when you draw a square, its made by connecting 4 likes together. Now in 3D modelling, we have a term called "topology", whereas a model has to have a 
consistent flow of lines to make it look equal. So if say for example you have a shape, where there's alot of lines on the left but it's just blank on the right, that's called bad topology. Specifically, it's "crowded" or "dense". Another issue was the fact that it was all wonky. Normally, a car is supposed to flow smooth, for the airflow.
the body lines are supposed to curve properly. Since I didn't know how to manipulate the verts, I ended up having a body panel that looked "hilly". Other than that, I think I did pretty good. I mean, the average person that learns 3D Modelling doesn't really start with cars, so I'd say i've got some sort of edge. Also, all it took was practice. LOTS and LOTS of
practice. Since I have a purpose to build models, i have all the reason to be able to practice. I've kept up modelling since 2020, and it's almost 2025. I'd say I improved. Anyways, while I was cooped up at home modelling, school finally resumed but online. It was pretty terrible, since everyone was online. I didn't get to see my friends, and it still felt bleak.
But, all this would end soon.
</p>

<h1 class="head">Senior Years</h1>
<p class="text">Come 2022, and I finally graduated. Although, it still felt pretty terrible since I felt like i learned nothing these past years. Since people were barely attentive during the online class, no one really learned anything. Either way, I finally graduated and moved out to STI College Global City. <br>
Now, I really didn't like this school solely because of their teaching methods and their staff. But, the saving grace for me were the amazing people i had to endure it with. Alot of my new friends were made here, and i'm glad I met them here. Because despite the difficulty in our school works being so spontaneous with no proper explaination,
I was able to push thru with these because of the people that I experienced this with. There really isn't much to say about my years in Senior High due to how short it was, and the fact that on most days the teachers weren't even present so we only learned stuff thru the documentation.
To cut short, my time here was pretty terrible but not as bad.</p>

<h1 class="head">Entering CIIT</h1>
<p class="text">I graduated again 2024, and it still felt like a daze. But, I was happy that I was finally out of that school. Of course, i'll miss the people there, But i know for sure i won't miss the school itself. A year prior to my graduation, I was able to take the CIIT entrance exam extremely early. In fact, it was so early that 
    as soon as I finished my exam, I got my results the same night. Of course, I passed! I felt so happy since CIIT was my ONLY option. I wanted to be able to use my learned 3D modelling skills and apply it for good. Months passed, and it was finally time to go to college. I was pretty scared for my first day honestly, since I've never went as far as another city on my own
    for commute. especially going from Makati/Taguig all the way to Quezon City is a new experience for me. Another thing, it was my first time taking a bus since i usually just do jeep and tricycle or go by taxi. But, i mustered up the courage and pushed thru with the trip.<br>
    <br>
    Once I arrived on site, I was a little early. They weren't allowing the students in yet, so I had to wait outside with other students. around 8:00 they finally let us in, and I made my way to my room. Everything was quiet, which is normal for first days. But, eventually I started to pick up chatting with my peers and made small discussions with them.
    We had our school tour during this day aswell, also we had our first meetings with our teachers. It was fun, and I knew i had a great college life ahead of me. I hope it'll stay that way for the rest of my College years.
